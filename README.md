# WP-API SOCIAL LOGIN
We can do many awesome things with WP-API, when building [CodeCavalry](https://codecavalry.com) we needed a way to get people signed up logged in using social networks. While trying some existing plugins were not happy with the outcome and how the flow worked with our application. We created the start to a social login utilizing WP-API to more seamlessly integrate the login and registration.
  
This is v2 of our routes and plugin that includes a new table since some social API's don't respond with information you need to check if a user exists or create a user.
